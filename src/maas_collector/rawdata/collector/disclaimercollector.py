"""Collect SAR-MPC Quality Disclaimers by scraping https://sar-mpc.eu/disclaimers/

The collector walks the paginated HTML listing, opens each disclaimer detail
page, extracts every field shown there (the *last modified* date is the database
reference), downloads the attached PDF report and extracts its content with the
MPC PDF parser. Each disclaimer is emitted as a single JSON document mapped to
the raw-data model by a ``JSONExtractor``.
